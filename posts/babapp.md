_I've decided to share a copy of my application essay to Blockchain at Berkeley from 2021. I became introduced to the philosophies and motivations surrounding blockchain in late 2020 and started looking deeper the following year. This essay was written early in my entrance to the field, and much time has passed since. I think it's nice to look back at a snapshot of my initial motivations in entering the space. Maybe you'll enjoy it as well._

In September of last year, the country of my origin, Armenia, fell into a devastating war. Even though I was some 7,000 miles from the action, I all too clearly got to see the dance of dictators. I came to learn of the unchecked powers of sovereign nations, and the total disconnect between the interests of these players of centralized power and the ordinary masses at the expense of which they play their games.

Given this backdrop, I became enthralled in the philosophy of the cypherpunk movement. Bitcoin proved that we can overcome something as intrinsic to humans as untrustworthiness to bring about trustless interaction in the context of finance. My motivation now is the exploration of the other facets of human interaction that such a philosophy can be applied to. Can a protocol be built for trustless and secure interaction between humans in the political realm, where politicians and governments are truly held accountable? How much of society can we put into a decentralized model, where people can own themselves, infrastructure, and their governance? In a perfect way, I came across the computer science solution to the heavy sociological issue that burdened my conscience. I knew that this was the technology to which I will devote my life’s work.

Naturally, these questions are big, and their aims bigger. Their exploration, then, largely depends on the greater education, awareness, and adoption of the technology and its potential. For this reason, I’ve become passionate about sharing these ideas that inspired me, especially in a way that extends the reach of this information. Currently, I’m working on a set of educational videos in Armenian, as I see that small countries such as it are some of the most optimal places to test and prove the efficacy of blockchain systems. Cases such as Estonia and its openness to using blockchain to secure public records coupled with the exploration of new governance models we see via DAOs excites me, and makes me optimistic about innovation in our systems of government and public infrastructure. In the vein of infrastructure, I find great potential in the idea promoted by technologies such as Helium, which prove the feasibility of bringing blockchain into physical networks. I would like to see a world where the people can have greater ownership of the infrastructure that we all depend on. 

Lucky to be at the onset of this field, I look forward to inspiring others by sharing the things I learn on my own path of education. I’ve had a chance to speak with incredibly inspiring people in Blockchain at Berkeley, and I would love for the opportunity to join, work, and grow with you all.
