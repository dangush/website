# Personal Website

A minimalist platform for my bio, contact, blog, and any misc fun things. 

# TODO

- Think of a way to incorporate other digitized records of mine into the site- book reading, article reading, tweets, music, etc. 
- Find a new favicon. dogchamp from 5 years ago may start to be getting outdated. 
- Incorporate easter eggs, hidden links, etc.
