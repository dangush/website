Oikos is a solid standard for the '~12g protein, ~1g fat, ~12g sugar' category of yogurts. Their maindrawback constitutes in flavor. Generally speaking, their flavors feel cheap and relatively artificial. The pre-mixed nature and lack of real fruits adds to this. 

While well-suited for gym-goers like myself who can take the hit on flavor for nutrition purposes, I found myself drifting away from Oikos recently to better, realer tasting flavored yogurts, such as Chobani and Ellenos.


# NOW. This is NOT review about the standard Oikos yogurts. This is a review of the Oikos **PRO**. 

> A cool new pick I found at Ralphs the other day.

1. Flavor: 4/5
