Oikos is a solid standard for the '~12g protein, ~1g fat, ~12g sugar' category of yogurts. Their maindrawback constitutes in flavor. Generally speaking, their flavors feel cheap and relatively artificial. The pre-mixed nature and lack of real fruits adds to this. 

While well-suited for gym-goers like myself who can take the hit on flavor for nutrition purposes, I found myself drifting away from Oikos recently to better, realer tasting flavored yogurts, such as Chobani and Ellenos.

*Until this*

With the crap load of protein, the yogurt has a beautiful thickness and firm texture. I mean I could carve out a spoonful and it'll keep its shape like the hoover dam. My obsession with 'firm' yogurt is my personal preference ofc, but if you're reading this then you know my personal opinion is right anyway.

In terms of flavor, Oikos is still Oikos with its relatively artifical tasting flavors (I'm not sure if this bland flavor comes from it being premixed or otherwise). However, the more-than-usual low sugar content of this product makes the flavor much more subtle, and hence less bothersome. It becomes more pleasant ambient music than a high school concert. 

Nutrition is obviously fantastic. Next to 0 fat, particularly low sugar, and nearly double the protein content of other offerings from the likes of Chobani. Assuming that they're not pulling any dirty tricks to get the protein content up, there's nothing to complain about this.

The last criteria that my roommate and I settled to judge yogurts on is "aesthetic". Flavor and nutrition is simply not enough anymore in our modern lifestyles. Oikos always had a more 'edgy' aesthetic with the use of black on their branding, and this line only leans into it more. I have no problems with it, and am generally a fan of black. At the end of the day though, it's about as standard as you can get with packaging, so I'll have to give it a 4/5. 

## Numbers
1. Flavor & Texture: 5/5
2. Nutrition: 5/5
3. Aesthetic: 4/5

### Total: 4.5/5

Overall, Oikos Pro 20G yogurt comes down to a 4.5/5 rating. Fantastic choice, really glad I randomly saw it at Ralphs.
