The think! bar stands out immediately for not standing out at all amongst the pleathora of Santa Monica yoga instructor protein bars that flood the selected shelf in every store. The options range in flavors and macros, including both 10g[^1] and 20g options. Just like you don't understand how the Santa Monica yoga instructors make their living, you won't understand how this bar proudly advertises containing 0g of sugar while also claiming to have *no artificial sweetners!*
I tried the 'brownie crunch' flavor, which contains 20g of protein.

This was an interesting example of flavor and texture qualities being wildly separate. In terms of texture, the bar is pretty soft with a somewhat harder shell. It's nothing mind blowing, but not unpleasant at all either. The flavor, however, unfortunately suffers quite a bit from whatever their attempt to sweeten this thing with is. The strong bitter aftertaste that overpowers everything really undoes any semblance of custom flavoring that the bar intends to portray. As I got through the bar the experience of bitterness only got worse, to the point where I didn't finish the bar - unheardof for my fatass self.

For macronutrients, the bar is fine, pretty standard. Liberterians on twitter will probably argue something against the usage of various seed oils, and while I do care about food and nutrition, I frankly don't right now as I hungrily type this on a family vacation in the hellhole that is the Las Vegas strip.

Aesthetically, the branding is simply inoffensive. The colors are mild and the design friendly, as if they are trying to carefully tame unhealthy snackers into higher-protein foods the way you tame ocelots in minecraft. I'm offended by inoffensiveness, and as such, not a fan. 

### Numbers
1. Flavor & Texture: 2/5 (flavor: 1/5, texture: 3/5)
2. Nutrition: 3/5
3. Aesthetic: 2/5

### Total: 
#### 2/5


Conclusion

Honestly, not the end of the world if you're in a limited selection and have to grab one of these. But there are better options.


[^1]: It is my personal opinion that no bar with <=10g of protein should market itself as a "protein bar". An everything bagel has ~9g of protein. Are we gonna start calling those protein bagels now? Let's not dilute the term.
