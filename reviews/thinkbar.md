The think! bar stands out immediately for not standing out at all amongst the pleathora of quirky 'LA girl' protein bars that flood the selected shelf in every store. The options range in flavors and macros, including both 10g[^1] and 20g options. As quirky protein bars often do, they proudly advertise containing 0g of sugar. This one even claims to have *no artificial sweetners!*
I tried the 'brownie crunch' flavor, which contains 20g of protein.

This was an interesting example of flavor and texture qualities being wildly separate. In terms of texture, the bar is pretty soft with a somewhat harder shell. It's nothing mind blowing, but not unpleasant at all either. The flavor, however, unfortunately suffers quite a bit from the ~~artifical sugar that they use.~~ ah that's right, apparently it's not fake sugar. 

Well, regardless of whatever the hell they use, the fact is that it leaves a strong bitter aftertaste that really undoes any semblance of custom flavoring that the bar intends to portray. As I got through the bar the bitterness got worse, so I definitely think it takes away from the experience quite a bit. 

Nutritionally, the bar is fine, pretty standard. Not sure how they achieve that sugar situation, but the taste definitely sus's me out on it. 

Aesthetically, I think they have good, inoffensive branding. But I don't like inoffensive. It's too calm and reminds me of LA girls doing yoga on a sunday at the park near a beach. Can't say it's *bad*, can't say I'm excited by it either. 

### Numbers
1. Flavor & Texture: 2/5 (flavor: 1/5, texture: 3/5)
2. Nutrition: 4/5
3. Aesthetic: 2.5/5

### Total: 
#### 2/5


Conclusion

Honestly, not an offensive bar in the least. The flavor is pretty ass, but if you need some protein and you don't have many other options, you won't have such a difficult life choosing to eat this.


[^1]: It is my personal opinion that no bar with <=10g of protein should market itself as a "protein bar". An everything bagel has 9g of protein. Are we gonna start calling those protein bagels now? Let's not dilute the term.
