This is the winner.

My conviction in this product has only gone up over time, and exponentially so. Every time I eat a Barebells bar, I'm more blown away at the work that they've done than before. 

I thought 200 calorie, 20g protein bars were going to be forever stuck at the disappointing quality of Quest, think!, etc. But no.

These swedes have figured it out. Crunchy on the outside with real tasting chocolate (that melts at slightly above room temperature!), beautifully creamy and flavorful on the inside, all the macros you could pray for, the price you're willing to pay -- everything. 

For example, let's take the chocolate dough flavor. Can anyone put into words wtf chocolate dough even means? I certainly can't. 

But let me tell you, this shit tastes *exactly* like chocolate dough. 

It's this beautiful, rich, creamy milk chocolate taste, similar to a brownie with a chocolate filling. On the outside, little chocolate sprinkles that give a beautiful crackle to every bite. It's insane to imagine that you're eating 20 grams of protein with zero sugar.

I'm so obsessed with this product that I literally couldn't even care to question what sus sugar they use to make this work. 

### Numbers
1. Flavor & Texture: 5/5
2. Nutrition: 5/5
3. Aesthetic: 5/5

### Total: 
#### 5/5

Honestly, that's all I'm going to say. Get this next time you're at Trader Joe's, or wherever. 

There's nothing better. QED.
