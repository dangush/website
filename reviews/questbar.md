Quest bars are what the leprechaun promises is at the end of the rainbow. A protein bar that tastes great with crazy flavors, has no sugar, high protein, and relatively low calories. 

But like the gold, that shit doesn't exist. 

First thing that you experience after managing to unwrap the packaging that's glued to the sticky brick of protein and ??? is the texture. I don't know how Quest does it, but it seems like they make these shits by mixing in protein powder with elmers glue and injecting it into an industrial-scale molding process where no human ever interacts with the food. The bar is unbearably firm, and the unique flavors are disappointingly bland compared to the hype that the (admittedly good) branding and design gets you ready for. Don't get me wrong, the flavors are and sweetness is definitely there, but the texture and experience eating it really doesn't make you very much appreciative of it. 

I've heard recommendations to *microwave* the bars to make them soft and more enjoyable to eat. I haven't tried doing that recently enough to evaluate the suggestion, but from a product perspective, I absolutely cannot agree with a *protein bar* needing a *microwave* to be consumed. I move on.

Nutrition wise, the bar is pretty good. The calories are respectable relative to its protein count, and sugar is not high. 
Even though I just noted the low sugar as a plus, this comes with a major caveat that makes me actually dislike the bar: 
*where is the sweetness coming from?*. The bar is incredibly flavorful yet with no sugar. I literally feel like some chemicals are infecting my body when thinking about the reverberation of that.


### Numbers
1. Flavor & Texture: 1/5
2. Nutrition: 3.5/5
3. Aesthetic: 4/5

### Total: 
#### 1.5/5


In conclusion, the Quest bar is a good pickup if you need strict calories and are willing to blind yourself to the taste & potential health implications. It saddens me that this well-branded bar failed to convince me to be a bigger fan.
