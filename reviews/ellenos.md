Ellenos was the golden goose that Alton discovered in his (disgusting choice of) shopping at Berkeley Bowl. 

Initially, we were enamored by the creaminess & fruit flavorings. The fruit flavors are fantastic and natural tasting- passion fruit was actually mind blowing to have with yogurt. The main issue we mostly ignored while obsessing over the flavors, however, is the nutrition. Each cup is around a whopping 240 calories, nearly double regular greek yogurts. Some of this comes with the high protein content, around ~17g. A lot of it, however, is the nearly 10g of fat. 

Personally, I'm a fan of firm texture. With ~10g, the creaminess was kind of exciting as a novelty, but it quickly dawns on you that you're just consuming fat (no, I don't have problems in my relationship with food just cuz I'm complaining about 10g of fat). This was a pretty big turnoff for both Alton and I as we got over the hype and started to appreciate other, lesser fat content yogurts. 

Aesthetically, Ellenos is fire. White and blue theme harkoning back to mother Greece, completely pointless but enjoyable plastic cap on the yogurt cup, transparency, well designed logo and lettering. Great job to their design/branding team. 

### Numbers
1. Flavor & Texture: 5/5
2. Nutrition: 4/5
3. Aesthetic: 5/5

### Total: 
#### 4.5/5


All in all, Ellenos is a fantastic choice of Greek yogurt, especially if you're a fan of creaminess. The fruit flavors are delightful, the nutrition is on point, and it looks dope. While the score technically adds up to 4.5/5, I'm going to pull a little bs and adjust to a 4/5, just because that's more accurate to how I feel about it right now. Give it a try!
